# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: june 17, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Went through stl template library in geeksforgeeks - algorithms, containers, functions, iterators. going through "must do coding questions" in GFG. solving problems in arrays section.

**Thoughts:** 
1. Took some time completing the first problem with minimal time complexity without o(n^2)
2. Second one was solved faster but first method's time complexity is high. Figured out a solution by writing done all steps in paper.
3. Kadane's problem- solved in long method, some test cases didnt pass. found short solution
4. got it on first try
5. got a solution, time complexity is high. using emplace() in vectors

### Day 2: June 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going through problems in array section of GFG. going through searching algorithms.

**Thoughts**
1. Did in direct way. got timeout error for some test cases. found an easy solution by method of storing two elems in one space using divisor/quotient method.
2. went with direct method. timeout. easy method, tough to think without help
3. Found a direct solution. GFG uses a technique similar to merge sort
4. had an overview on searching algorithms

### Day 3: June 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going through problems in array section of GFG.

**Thoughts**
1. got it on first try
1. got it on first try with space o(n), found o(1) space solution
3. missed logic on first try. got it second on try.
4. got in first try
5. got direct solution - sort & return, found min heap by priority queue solution
6. wrote a solution with some edge cases failing. GFG solution looks good
7. similar to counting triplets problem. got on first try.
8. timeout on first try. used ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) && cin.tie(NULL) to get faster solution

**Thoughts**
1. missed some edge cases. got after couple of tries
2. got it on first try
3. got it on first try
4. had problem with logic, didnt solve all cases. had pblms with pow(10,0). GFG solution using stoi is much simpler.

7. missed one edge case. got it on second try
8. got it on first try. A-Z = 65-90, a-z = 97-122

### Day 6: June 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: going through string section of GFG, linked list section of GFG

1. got it on first try
2. got it on first try
3. had to eliminate some edge cases. did using 'struct'. GFG solution is done using 'map'
4. got it on first try
5. Brushed up on pointers, new keyword, linked list basics. got it in first try
6. got it on first try

### Day 7: June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: going through linked list section of GFG. Started stack section

**Thoughts**
1. got it after two tries. used multiply by -1

3. got it in first try. two heads moving fwd based on comparision
4. got it after eliminating 'seg fault'
5. got it in first try. used arr[3] to store count of 0,1,2
6. good understanding of pointer gives one line solution. other solution involves changing data values to prev
7. got it in two tries
8. got it after little trick- insert new node at head
9. got it in first try. stack
