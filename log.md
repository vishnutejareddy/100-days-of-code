# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: june 17, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Went through stl template library in geeksforgeeks - algorithms, containers, functions, iterators. going through "must do coding questions" in GFG. solving problems in arrays section.

**Thoughts:** 
1. Took some time completing the first problem with minimal time complexity without o(n^2)
2. Second one was solved faster but first method's time complexity is high. Figured out a solution by writing done all steps in paper.
3. Kadane's problem- solved in long method, some test cases didnt pass. found short solution
4. got it on first try
5. got a solution, time complexity is high. using emplace() in vectors

### Day 1: June 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going through problems in array section of GFG. going through searching algorithms.

**Thoughts**
1. Did in direct way. got timeout error for some test cases. found an easy solution by method of storing two elems in one space using divisor/quotient method.
2. went with direct method. timeout. easy method, tough to think without help
3. Found a direct solution. GFG uses a technique similar to merge sort
4. had an overview on searching algorithms
