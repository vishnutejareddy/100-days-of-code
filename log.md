# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: june 17, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Went through stl template library in geeksforgeeks - algorithms, containers, functions, iterators. going through "must do coding questions" in GFG. solving problems in arrays section.

**Thoughts:** 
1. Took some time completing the first problem with minimal time complexity without o(n^2)
2. Second one was solved faster but first method's time complexity is high. Figured out a solution by writing done all steps in paper.
3. Kadane's problem- solved in long method, some test cases didnt pass. found short solution
4. got it on first try
5. got a solution, time complexity is high. using emplace() in vectors

### Day 1: June 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going through problems in array section of GFG. going through searching algorithms.

**Thoughts**
1. Did in direct way. got timeout error for some test cases. found an easy solution by method of storing two elems in one space using divisor/quotient method.
2. went with direct method. timeout. easy method, tough to think without help
3. Found a direct solution. GFG uses a technique similar to merge sort
4. had an overview on searching algorithms

3. [Inversion-of-array](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/inversion-of-array/0/)
4. [linear-search,binary-search,jump-search,interpolation-search,exponential-search]


### Day 2: June 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going through problems in array section of GFG.

**Thoughts**
1. got it on first try
1. got it on first try with space o(n), found o(1) space solution
3. missed logic on first try. got it second on try.
4. got in first try
5. got direct solution - sort & return, found min heap by priority queue solution
6. wrote a solution with some edge cases failing. GFG solution looks good
7. similar to counting triplets problem. got on first try.
8. timeout on first try. used ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) && cin.tie(NULL) to get faster solution
